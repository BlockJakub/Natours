The importance (precedence) of rem, em, %, and px depends on context rather than strict hierarchy. However, 
here's a breakdown of when each is more dominant:

1️⃣ px (Pixels) – Absolute & Strongest
    Fixed size: It doesn’t scale with anything, meaning it's always the same no matter the parent or root element.
    Precedence: If an element has a px value, it won’t change based on user settings or surrounding elements.
    Best for: Precise layouts, borders, or when you want something to stay a fixed size.
2️⃣ rem (Root EM) – Best for Consistent Scaling
    Relative to html font-size (1rem = root font size).
    If no root font-size is set, defaults to 16px in most browsers.
    Precedence: It overrides % and em if applied directly because it's based on the root.
    Best for: Consistent typography and scalable layouts across the whole page.
3️⃣ em (Relative to Parent)
    Relative to the font-size of its direct parent.
    If nested, it compounds (1.2em inside another 1.2em means 1.2 × 1.2 = 1.44x).
    Precedence: It's weaker than px and rem since it depends on its parent.
    Best for: Component-based scaling (like buttons growing inside bigger containers).
4️⃣ % (Relative to Parent’s Dimension, Not Font Size)
    Used mostly for widths, heights, paddings, and margins.
    Relative to the parent element (e.g., width: 50% makes it half of its parent).
    Precedence: It's weaker than px, rem, and em when it comes to font-size but is very useful in flexible layouts.
    Best for: Responsive layouts where elements should resize based on their container.
    Which Takes Precedence?
    If px is used, it wins (because it's absolute and doesn’t scale).
  !!!-> rem wins over em in most cases because it’s based on the root, not a parent.
  !!!-> em depends on its parent and can be overridden by rem or px.
  !!!-> % is dependent on the parent and is weaker than the rest for font sizing.

What Should You Use?
    ✅ Use rem for font sizes → Keeps everything scalable and accessible.
    ✅ Use % or em for fluid layouts → Helps with responsiveness.
    ✅ Use px for precise elements like borders or small UI components where you need full control.

Since you like clean structure, I’d say stick with rem for text, % for layout, and px for strict sizes. 🚀
