Guide to CSS Positioning (static, relative, fixed, absolute, sticky)
In CSS, the position property controls how elements are positioned on the page. 
It defines the type of positioning method for an element, which in turn determines 
how the element behaves within the page layout.
=============================================================================================
üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ position: static (Default Positioning)

    Purpose: This is the default value for all elements. 
            It positions elements according to the normal document flow.

    Explanation: Elements with position: static are positioned based on the normal flow of the document and are not affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties.

    Use Case: Used when you want the element to follow the regular flow of the document without special positioning.

‚úÖ Example:


        div {
          position: static;
        }
  
  -- HTML Structure:

        <div>Content here</div>

üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ position: relative (Relative Positioning)

    Purpose: Positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.

    Explanation: An element with position: relative can be moved using the top, right, bottom, and left properties, but it still occupies its original position in the document layout.

    Use Case: When you want to move an element slightly without removing it from the document flow. It is also often used as a reference point for absolutely positioned child elements.

‚úÖ Example:


        div {
          position: relative;
          top: 20px;
        }
   
   -- HTML Structure:
    <div>Relative positioning example</div>

üîπ 3Ô∏è‚É£ position: fixed (Fixed Positioning)

    Purpose: Fixes an element relative to the viewport (the browser window).

    Explanation: An element with position: fixed will remain in the same place on the screen, even when the user scrolls the page. You can adjust its position with top, right, bottom, and left.

    Use Case: For elements that should always be visible, like sticky headers or floating buttons, no matter how much the user scrolls.

‚úÖ Example:

        header {
          position: fixed;
          top: 0;
          width: 100%;
        }
   -- HTML Structure:
        <header>Fixed Header</header>

üîπ 4Ô∏è‚É£ position: absolute (Absolute Positioning)

    Purpose: Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).

    Explanation: An element with position: absolute is removed from the normal document flow and can be positioned anywhere within its containing block. It uses the top, right, bottom, and left properties for positioning.

    Use Case: When you need to precisely control the position of an element within a container, such as placing a tooltip, modal, or overlay.

‚úÖ Example:

        .container {
          position: relative;
        }
        .box {
          position: absolute;
          top: 50px;
          left: 100px;
        }
   -- HTML Structure:
        <div class="container">
            <div class="box">Absolute Positioned Box</div>
        </div>

üîπ 5Ô∏è‚É£ position: sticky (Sticky Positioning)

    Purpose: The element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the user's scroll position.

    Explanation: An element with position: sticky acts like a relative element until the user scrolls past a defined position, at which point it "sticks" to that position (like fixed). It behaves like a regular element until that point and then becomes fixed as you scroll.

    Use Case: Ideal for sticky headers, sticky sidebars, or navigation menus that stay visible as you scroll but only within their container.

‚úÖ Example:

        header {
          position: sticky;
          top: 0;
          background-color: #fff;
        }

   -- HTML Structure:
        <header>Sticky Header</header>

üîπ 6Ô∏è‚É£ position: inherit (Inherit Positioning)

    Purpose: Inherits the position value from its parent element.

    Explanation: The element inherits its position from the parent element, so if the parent is set to relative, the child will also be relative unless otherwise specified.

    Use Case: Useful when you want consistency across elements within the same container.

‚úÖ Example:

        .child {
          position: inherit;
        }

   -- HTML Structure:
        <div style="position: relative;">
            <div class="child">Inheriting Position</div>
        </div>

üîπ 7Ô∏è‚É£ position: initial (Initial Positioning)

    Purpose: Resets the position property to its default value (static).

    Explanation: Using position: initial reverts the positioning to the initial default (static), overriding any other positioning set earlier.

    Use Case: To remove custom positioning and restore the default behavior.

‚úÖ Example:

        .element {
          position: initial;
        }

   -- HTML Structure:
        <div class="element">Element with Initial Position</div>
