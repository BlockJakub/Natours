Guide to CSS Combinators and Selectors (+, ~, >, *, ^, etc.)

In CSS, combinators define relationships between elements. 
They help select elements based on their position in the HTML structure.

🔹 Sibling Selectors (+ and ~)
Sibling selectors target elements that share the same parent.

1️⃣ + (Adjacent Sibling Selector)
Selects the first sibling that comes immediately after another element.
If there are multiple siblings, it only selects the first one.
✅ Example:

        input:placeholder-shown + label {
          color: red;
        }
Explanation:

If the input field is empty (placeholder is shown), the next label sibling changes color to red.
    + only applies if the label is immediately after input.

🔹 Correct HTML Structure for + to Work:

        <div>
          <input type="text" placeholder="Enter name">
          <label>Name</label>  <!-- This label is immediately after input -->
        </div>

🔹 Wrong Structure (This Won't Work with +)

        <div>
          <input type="text" placeholder="Enter name">
          <span></span>  <!-- Another element in between -->
          <label>Name</label>
        </div>
    Why? ❌ label is not immediately after input.

2️⃣ ~ (General Sibling Selector)
Selects all sibling elements after the specified element, not just the first one.
✅ Example:


        input:placeholder-shown ~ label {
          color: blue;
        }
🔹 Correct HTML Structure for ~ to Work:


        <div>
          <input type="text" placeholder="Enter name">
          <span></span>  <!-- Another sibling -->
          <label>Name</label>  <!-- Still gets affected -->
        </div>
Why? ✅ ~ applies to any sibling after input, not just the first one.

🔹 Other Important CSS Combinators
3️⃣ > (Direct Child Selector)
Selects only direct child elements of a parent.
✅ Example:

        
        .container > p {
          color: green;
        }

🔹 Correct HTML Structure for > to Work:

        <div class="container">
          <p>Direct child</p>  <!-- ✅ Gets styled -->
          <div>
            <p>Nested child</p>  <!-- ❌ Won't be styled -->
          </div>
        </div>
Why? ❌ The second <p> is inside another <div>, so it’s not a direct child.

4️⃣ * (Universal Selector)
Selects all elements.
✅ Example:


        * {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
        }
👉 This removes default margins and paddings from all elements.

5️⃣ ^, $, * (Attribute Selectors)
Used to select elements based on attributes.

         Selector	            Meaning
       [attr^="value"]	    Starts with value
       [attr$="value"]	    Ends with value
       [attr*="value"]	    Contains value
✅ Example:


        a[href^="https"] {
          color: blue;
        }
👉 This targets all links that start with https.

✅ Another Example:


        input[type$="password"] {
          border: 2px solid red;
        }
👉 This applies styles to any <input> where type ends with "password".

✅ Another Example:


        div[class*="box"] {
          background-color: yellow;
        }
👉 This applies to any div with "box" in its class name, like .big-box, .small-box, etc.

📌 Summary Table of CSS Combinators
  Combinator	            Meaning	                                       Example
    +	             Selects the first sibling that comes right after	  div + p {}
    ~	             Selects all siblings that come after	              div ~ p {}
    >	             Selects only direct children	                      .parent > .child {}
    *	             Selects everything	                                  * {}
  [attr^="val"]	     Selects elements starting with "val"	              a[href^="https"] {}
  [attr$="val"]	     Selects elements ending with "val"	                  img[src$=".jpg"] {}
  [attr*="val"]	     Selects elements containing "val"	                  div[class*="box"] {}

=========================================================================================================
    Conclusion
        + → Selects the next sibling only (one).
        ~ → Selects all siblings after.
        > → Selects only direct children.
        * → Selects everything.
        ^, $, * → Selects elements based on attribute values.
