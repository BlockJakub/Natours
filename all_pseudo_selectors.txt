Guide to Pseudo-Elements (::) and Pseudo-Classes (:) in CSS
In CSS, pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are used to style specific parts of elements or apply styles based on certain conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Pseudo-Classes (:) â†’ Represents an Element's State
ðŸ”¸ Pseudo-classes start with a single colon (:) and are used to apply styles based on the state of an element.

ðŸ“Œ Example of Pseudo-Classes:

        button:hover {
          background-color: blue;
        }
Explanation:

    :hover applies styles when the user hovers over the button.
It does not create a new element; it just modifies an existing element based on its state.
ðŸ“Œ Common Pseudo-Classes:

Pseudo-Class	Description
    :hover	When the user hovers over an element.
    :focus	When an input field is selected.
    :nth-child(n)	Targets the nth child of a parent.
    :first-child	Targets the first child of a parent.
    :last-child	Targets the last child of a parent.
    :checked	When a checkbox is checked.
âœ… Example Usage:


        input:focus {
          border: 2px solid red;
        }
ðŸ‘‰ This will add a red border when the user clicks inside the input field.

ðŸ”¹ Pseudo-Elements (::) â†’ Targets Part of an Element
ðŸ”¸ Pseudo-elements start with two colons (::) and are used to style specific parts of an element.

ðŸ“Œ Example of Pseudo-Elements:


        p::first-letter {
          font-size: 2rem;
          color: red;
        }
Explanation:

    ::first-letter only affects the first letter of a <p> element.
    This is useful for creating stylized text effects.

ðŸ“Œ Common Pseudo-Elements:

Pseudo-Element	Description
    ::before	Inserts content before an element.
    ::after	Inserts content after an element.
    ::first-letter	Styles the first letter of text.
    ::first-line	Styles the first line of text.
    ::selection	Styles the part of text selected by the user.
âœ… Example Usage:


    h1::before {
      content: "ðŸ”¥ ";
    }
ðŸ‘‰ This will add a fire emoji before every <h1> heading.

âœ… Another Example (::after)


        button::after {
          content: " âœ”";
          color: green;
        }
ðŸ‘‰ This will add a green checkmark after every button.
